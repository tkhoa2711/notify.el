#+TITLE: notify.el - A minimal library for notification in emacs lisp
#+AUTHOR: Khoa Le
#+EMAIL: ltkhoa2711@gmail.com
#+STARTUP: showall

* Installation

You can install it simply by cloning this library into your load path.
Put the following code somewhere in your emacs init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'notify)
#+end_src

Optionally, you can run the tests to make sure everything works fine:

#+begin_src sh
make test
#+end_src

* Usage

And you're good to go:

#+begin_src elisp
(notify "title" "hello world!")
#+end_src

By default, Emacs minibuffer is used. However, if you have [[http://growl.info/][Growl]] install,
it is supported off the shelf.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq notify-function 'notify-growl)

;; set path to the "growlnotify" executable if it's not already in your PATH env variable
;; it's "growlnotify.com" on Windows, and "gol" on Linux
(setq 'notify-growl-executable "/usr/local/bin/growlnotify")
#+end_src

In fact, the library is open for anyone to implement their own ~notify-function~.
